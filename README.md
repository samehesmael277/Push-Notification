## Technologies Used

- **Java**: The app is built using the Java programming language.
- **View Binding**: Utilizes View Binding for efficient and type-safe access to UI components.

The Push Notification app provides a basic example of how to work with notifications and data passing in Android using Java and View Binding. It's a great starting point for developers learning about these concepts.
